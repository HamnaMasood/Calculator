# Calculator

This project is a simple HTML calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through an intuitive and responsive interface. The calculator features a clean design with buttons for numbers, operators, and a clear function to reset the display. The layout is created using HTML for structure, styled with CSS for appearance and responsiveness, and powered by JavaScript to handle all calculations and user interactions. The project is ideal for beginners who want to practice front-end development concepts like event handling, DOM manipulation, and styling. To use the calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in any web browser and start performing calculations. The code can also be easily customizedâ€”users can modify colors, button styles, or even add new operations to enhance functionality. This project is open-source and distributed under the MIT License, making it a great starting point for learning or building upon.
